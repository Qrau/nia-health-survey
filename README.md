- **Suggestions for improvments:**
> 1. move the states variables into a context api or redux to be able to share the states between pages and components.
> 2. use global styles and theme with a third party package such as "styled-components" for the app.
> 3. use React hooks and features like (memo, useMemo, useCallback) to improve the app performance.
> 4. implement SSR and ISR  with nextjs for better perforamnce.
